                    Larger businesses are legally required to calculate their carbon footprint for the carbon emissions they are directly responsible for (Scope 1) and the emissions the electricity supplied (Scope 2). Scope 3 emissions is the largest potential category for many businesses and includes the supply chain which to date has been voluntary to calculate. Many large businesses are focusing their NetZero approach to include Scope 3 emissions so companies are now asking all of the businesses they deal with to supply data on their own carbon emissions. If you are part of a supply chain for a larger business and are being asked information on your own carbon footprint then this is the course to help you.Duration1 Day, 09.00 - 17.00Who should attend?This course is recommended for individuals who are responsible for understanding and reliably calculating their company’s carbon footprint, for business owners who need to understand about carbon footprints and respond to their customer needs. It is also suitable for environmental managers given this responsibility or anyone who needs to increase their specific knowledge of this topic such as those who are involved in managing the supply chain (e.g., Procurement) and for Directors who find carbon accountable is now part of their remit.Course objectivesThis course aims to provide an understanding of terminology and definitions linked to carbon management. This course is an intensive workshop that focuses on the practical skills required to create a carbon footprint report and begin their route to NetZero.Course content
                    Understand carbon emissions terminology
                    Understand what a carbon footprint is and be familiar with the Greenhouse Gas Accounting Protocol
                    Measure your business carbon footprint
                    Create a carbon reduction plan
                    Carbon reduction technology options
                    What are the benefitsOn successful completion, delegates will have improved their knowledge of carbon management and be able to start to develop a NetZero plan for their business and be able to talk knowledgeably with their stakeholders including their customers and supply chain.In-House CoursesThis course is also available on an in-house basis which can allow courses to be modified to more closely match your specific business requirements. The course can be delivered either virtually or face-to-face.
