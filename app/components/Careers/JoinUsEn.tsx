                            As well as working on client projects, you may also
                            be involved in some internal initiatives, such as
                            helping to develop internal methodologies and
                            training materials and organising internal events.

                            development, amongst others. This helps you to
                            develop your general business skills based on what
                            interests you most, and allows you to stretch
