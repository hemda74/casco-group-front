                            On client projects you will be part of a team which,
                            depending on the nature of the project, could be
                            based either at the client’s site or in our offices,

                            within a stream, and your role is likely to vary

                            helping to develop internal methodologies and
                            training materials and organising internal events.
                            As you progress in the company, you are likely to

                            development, amongst others. This helps you to
                            develop your general business skills based on what
                            interests you most, and allows you to stretch
                            outside your comfort zone and work with colleagues
                            who you may not normally come across in your
